# RV85

We are creating a simulator of a processor like JC62 which can perform various functions like loading, storing, adding and many more. The code will be written in C++. The user can enter the code and the processor will convert it into machine language and perform the operation accordingly. 
There will be different registers to which have various functionalities:-

1. Read the data
2. Load the data
3. Store the data
4. Add
5. Subtract
6. Multiply
7. Write the data
8. Divide
9. Complement
10. Increment
11. Decrement
12. Jump
13. Halt
14. Jump on negative

All these operations will have a different function in C++. 
There will be an accumulator and ALU where different instructions will get executed.
